## What is an TIP?

TIP stands for TONCommunity.org Improvement Proposal. An TIP is a design document providing information to the community, or describing a new feature for TONCommunity.org or its processes or environment. The TIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The TIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## TIP Rationale

We intend TIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into TONCommunity.org. Because the TIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

For TONCommunity.org implementers, TIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally each implementation maintainer would list the TIPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.

## TIP Formats and Templates

TIPs should be written in [markdown] format. There is a [template](https://github.com/TONCommunity/ton-TIPs/blob/master/tip-template.md) to follow.

## Style Guide

When referring to an TIP by number, it should be written in the hyphenated form `TIP-X` where `X` is the TIP's assigned number.

## History

This document was derived heavily from [Ethereum's EIP-0001]  and [Bitcoin's BIP-0001] written by Amir Taaki which in turn was derived from [Python's PEP-0001]. In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although the PEP-0001 text was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, they are not responsible for its use in the Ethereum Improvement Process, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to Ethereum or the TIP. Please direct all comments to the TIP editors.
